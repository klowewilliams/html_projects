    <h2><a href="http://klowewilliams.com">Kimberly Lowe-Williams</a></h2>

    <p>I absolutely <b>LOVE</b> technology and often feel slighted when I am not able to keep up with all the latest and greatest tools, software and gadgets. Why am I often not able to keep up? I am a full time commuter, wife and mother! That’s right considered to be a bit of a computer geek by those keenly unaware of how much I do not know about computers… I delve into web developing as often as I possibly can. However, things are really about to pick up for me. I have joined the <a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com">Anyone Can Learn to Code</a> Spring/Summer 2015 cohort!

I am ready to get some new skills while mastering a few older ones:
    <ul>
        <li>Ruby
        <li>Rails
        <li>HTML
        <li>CSS
        <li>JavaScript
        <li>AngularJS
        <li>SQL
        <li>And Git
    </ul>
            
            <p>The most exciting part is that I already know HTML, CSS, SQL and some JavaScript (though not a master by any stretch of the imagination). All this while keeping my current job as a Software/Customer Support Analyst, self-appointed CTO of my church and hopefully my sanity.</p>

<p>In the words of the Hunger Game trilogy:<p>

….or in my case “my favor”.
